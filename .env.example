# All VITE_* variables are embedded in the client bundle and are visible in the browser.
# Only use values that are safe to share publicly (e.g. public URLs, form IDs). No secrets.

# WordPress GraphQL endpoint (required for Stories and headless content).
# Safe to expose: it is a public API URL. Your WordPress site must allow this frontend's origin in CORS.
VITE_WP_GRAPHQL_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com/graphql

# Optional: Media CDN base URL. When set, WordPress media URLs are rewritten to this origin (e.g. public S3 or CloudFront).
# When unset, media URLs are used as returned by WordPress so images load from your WordPress site (same as on the live post).
# Example: VITE_MEDIA_CDN_URL=https://leckerbisschen.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
# VITE_MEDIA_CDN_URL=

# Supabase (public) client configuration. These map to your Supabase project's URL
# and anon public key. They are safe to expose in the client but MUST NOT be
# service role keys. For Vercel: add the same names in Project → Settings → Environment Variables.
# For local login to work: in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration,
# add http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:5173 to "Redirect URLs" (otherwise auth redirects to Site URL).
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_public_anon_key

# Optional: Supabase service role key. Only for local scripts (e.g. migrate-wp-users-to-supabase.js).
# Never commit this or use it in frontend code.
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Substack newsletter publication URL (optional)
# VITE_SUBSTACK_PUBLICATION=https://yoursubstack.substack.com

# VITE_FORMSPREE_CONTACT_FORM_ID=your_formspree_form_id

# Stripe configuration (required for checkout)
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Your Stripe secret key (starts with sk_). NEVER expose this in client code.
# Add this in Vercel: Project → Settings → Environment Variables (server-side only).
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (for testing) or sk_live_... (for production)

# Optional: Site URL for checkout redirects (defaults to VERCEL_URL or localhost:3000)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.yoursite.com

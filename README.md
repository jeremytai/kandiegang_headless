# Kandie Gang Headless WordPress

## TO DO
- Events
  - add join waitlist CTA to event pages
- Normalize WordPress event descriptions so Markdown lists render correctly (handle en-dash/em-dash, common bullet characters, numbered markers like `)` or `.`, and strip zero-width/non-breaking spaces). Add a regression test or example content and remove dev-only debug UI after verification.
- [Done] Show event participants on each event page, grouped by ride level, for guides/admins.
- [Done] Migrate all serverless API handlers to Next.js `pages/api/` directory.
- [Done] Admin analytics participant management (remove, no-show, personal email).
- [Done] Guide dashboard at `/guide/analytics` with event stats, charts, and participant table.
- [Done] 24-hour event reminder emails (Vercel Cron, daily at 07:00 UTC).

## 🗓️ Event Signup & Early Access Logic

Event signups are gated by a **Public Release Date** set in WordPress ACF. Early access windows open before that date, controlled by env vars.

### Access Windows

| Window | Opens | Who can sign up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FLINTA* only | `FLINTA_EARLY_DAYS` (default: 7) days before release | FLINTA* riders only |
| Member + FLINTA* | `MEMBER_EARLY_DAYS` (default: 5) days before release | Members + FLINTA* riders |
| Public | Release date | Everyone |

> Both `VITE_FLINTA_EARLY_DAYS` / `VITE_MEMBER_EARLY_DAYS` (frontend) and `FLINTA_EARLY_DAYS` / `MEMBER_EARLY_DAYS` (API) must be set consistently in `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables.

### API enforcement (`api/event.ts`)

```ts
if (!isPublic) {
  if (inMemberWindow && !isMember && !flintaAttested)    → 403 "Member early access only."
  if (!inMemberWindow && inFlintaWindow && !flintaAttested) → 403 "FLINTA early access only."
  if (!inMemberWindow && !inFlintaWindow)                → 403 "Registration not open yet."
}
```

- `isMember` is resolved server-side from the caller's Supabase auth token (`profile.is_member`).
- Guest signups (no auth token) are treated as non-members and require Cloudflare Turnstile verification.
- `isFlintaOnly` events additionally require `flintaAttested` at all times.

### Authenticated member signup

When a logged-in member signs up, name entry is skipped if `profile.display_name` is set. If the display name is a single word (no last name), the full display name is sent as `firstName` and `lastName` is left empty — the API allows this for authenticated requests.

## 🚴 Gravel Grouprides

Gravel events are modeled as **single-level grouprides** with a dedicated ACF configuration and sidebar presentation:

- In WordPress ACF (`kandie-gang-grouprides-manager` plugin):
  - Set `Event Type` to `Groupride` and `Ride Category` to `Gravel`.
  - Use the **Gravel Guides** field (`gravelGuides`) for assigning guides (no per-level groups).
  - Use **Pace** (`gravelPace`), **Distance (km)** (`gravelDistanceKm`), and **Route URL** (`gravelRouteUrl`) for the ride details.
- In the frontend (`KandieEventPage` → `EventSidebarCard`):
  - Gravel rides render as a single pseudo-level called **“Gravel Ride”**.
  - The sidebar shows, in order: **Guides**, **Spots Available**, **Distance**, **Pace**, and **Route**, and uses the same early-access / waitlist logic as multi-level road rides.

_Documented: Feb 2026_

## 🔗 Discord Account Linking & Membership Unification

### How Discord Linking Works

- Users can link their Discord account to their membership profile from the Members Settings page (`/members/settings`).
- The "Connect Discord" button triggers the Discord OAuth flow. On success, the Discord user ID is stored in the user's profile.
- This allows users to access Discord member features even if their Discord email differs from their membership email.
- The UI displays the connected Discord username and avatar, and provides clear feedback on success or error.

**Security:**
- Linking is only possible when logged in, and the Discord OAuth flow ensures the user controls the Discord account being linked.
- Each Discord account can only be linked to one profile.

**Automated Backfill:**
- For legacy users, a one-time script can backfill `discord_id` in the `profiles` table by matching emails between Discord and membership accounts. This should only be used if emails are guaranteed to match.

**Recommended:**
- Encourage users to self-link via the Members Settings page for maximum security and clarity.

## 📂 Component Documentation

### Core Interactive Sections

- **`HomepageRotatingHeadline.tsx`**: Hero headline "You found us [photo]!" with `AnimatedHeadline` (char reveal + color fill) and rotating guide photos from `public/images/guides`.
- **`AnimatedHeadline.tsx`**: Reusable headline with SplitType (lines/words/chars) and GSAP: chars slide up on scroll, then color animates light grey → signal yellow → headline purple. Use `imageSrc` / `imageSrcSet` from `lib/images` for WebP and responsive widths.
- **`ExpandingHero.tsx`**: Hero section that expands from a rounded card to full-width using `clip-path` and `inset` based on scroll progress; uses responsive WebP via `lib/images`.
- **`HorizontalRevealSection.tsx`**: Horizontal scrolling gallery that pins to the screen, with a segmented navigation pill for the active section.
- **`ScrollingHeadline.tsx`**: Assembly animation where words ("Mundane made magic") fly into place as the user scrolls.
- **`CompanySection.tsx`**: "Your Guides" with TeamLink: profile images (from `public/images/guides`) spring into view and follow the cursor on hover. Guide names are derived from filenames—**first name only**, i.e. the part before the first underscore (e.g. `katrin_h.jpg` → "Katrin"; `jeremy.jpg` → "Jeremy"). Pills use secondary colors (Purple Rain, Current, Drift, Blush, Signal) with white text; on Signal (yellow) pills, text uses Current or Purple Rain for contrast. Guides are displayed in **random order** (shuffled once on mount).
- **`AboutHero.tsx`**: Immersive hero section with video background for the About page.
- **`AdaptationGrid.tsx`**: Showcases real-world autonomous tasks in a grid layout.
- **`FAQSection.tsx`**: Expandable FAQ section with smooth animations.
- **`NewsletterSection.tsx`**: Newsletter signup bar (“Get the latest in your inbox” / “Sign up to our newsletter”) with a Subscribe button; opens `NewsletterModal`.
- **`NewsletterModal.tsx`**: Centered modal that embeds your Substack publication’s signup form in an iframe when `VITE_SUBSTACK_PUBLICATION` is set. Includes a link to open the subscribe page in a new tab.

### UI Utilities

- **`StickyTop.tsx` / `StickyBottom.tsx`**: Glassmorphic floating containers that house primary navigation. They feature "scroll out" logic to disappear when the user moves deep into the page.
- **`FloatingClubMemberBar.tsx`**: A call-to-action pill visible on page load that gracefully exits as the user scrolls past the hero.
- **`Preloader.tsx`**: Loading animation that displays on initial page load.
- **`PasswordGate.tsx`**: Full-screen password gate shown after the preloader and before the site. Correct password unlocks the site; the unlock is stored in `sessionStorage` for the current tab/session so reloads skip the gate. Password is configured in the component (see [Site password](#-site-password) below).
- **`Footer.tsx`**: Site footer with navigation and links.
- **`ImageMarquee.tsx`**: Infinite scrolling image gallery.
- **`WeatherStatusBackground.tsx`**: Fixed yellow background on the landing page showing date (location timezone), location (from IP via ipapi.co), temperature and condition (Open-Meteo), and cycling outfit suggestion. Location defaults to Hamburg if IP lookup fails. No API keys required. Uses ipapi.co because it supports CORS; ip-api.com returns 403 for browser requests.

### Pages

- **`AboutPage.tsx`**: Editorial-style page with WordPress integration, featuring company vision, investor showcase, and careers CTA.
- **`CommunityPage.tsx`**: Technical deep-dive into AI and hardware technology, with WordPress content integration.
- **`StoriesPage.tsx`**: Journal/blog page that fetches posts from WordPress via GraphQL with fallback content.
- **`FontsPage.tsx`**: Comprehensive typography showcase displaying all font families, weights, styles, character sets, and usage examples.

## 🔌 Headless WordPress Integration

The project includes a robust WordPress GraphQL bridge (`lib/wordpress.ts`) with the following features:

### Features

- **Type-Safe Queries**: Full TypeScript support for WordPress data structures
- **Query Caching**: In-memory cache with 5-minute TTL for performance
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for network errors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback content
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient GraphQL queries that request only necessary data

### Usage

```typescript
import { wpQuery, getPageBySlug, getPostBySlug, GET_POSTS_QUERY } from './lib/wordpress';

// Fetch a page by slug
const page = await getPageBySlug('about');

// Fetch a post by slug
const post = await getPostBySlug('my-post');

// Custom GraphQL query
const data = await wpQuery<{ posts: { nodes: WPPost[] } }>(
  GET_POSTS_QUERY,
  { first: 10 },
  { useCache: true, retries: 2 }
);
```

### WordPress Setup

1. **Install WPGraphQL** on your WordPress site: [WPGraphQL plugin](https://www.wpgraphql.com/). Optionally add [WPGraphQL for ACF](https://www.wpgraphql.com/extensions/wpgraphql-for-acf/) if you use Advanced Custom Fields later.
2. **Set the env var**: In `.env` (copy from `.env.example`), set `VITE_WP_GRAPHQL_URL` to your GraphQL endpoint (e.g. `https://your-wordpress-site.com/graphql`). If unset, the app uses the fallback in `lib/wordpress.ts` (e.g. `https://wp-origin.kandiegang.com/graphql`).
3. **CORS**: Your WordPress site must allow your frontend origin (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`, or `https://www.kandiegang.com` in production) in CORS so the browser can call the GraphQL API. Use your host’s CORS settings or a plugin that allows the GraphQL endpoint for your origin.
4. **Validate**: Run the app and open `/stories` and a `/story/:slug`; posts should load. If you see “Unable to connect to WordPress” or “Showing archived content”, check the URL and CORS.
5. **Media CDN (optional)**: If you set `VITE_MEDIA_CDN_URL` so story images are served from S3, make the AWS bucket public. Example public image URL: `https://leckerbisschen.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10172203/251031_halloween_gravelo_abbett-72-scaled.jpg`

#### Stories not loading in production

If `/stories` shows “Unable to connect to WordPress” or only archived/fallback content:

1. **Set `VITE_WP_GRAPHQL_URL` in your hosting dashboard** (Vercel, Netlify, etc.). Vite bakes env vars at **build time**; add `VITE_WP_GRAPHQL_URL` with your real WordPress GraphQL URL (e.g. `https://wp-origin.kandiegang.com/graphql`), then **redeploy**.
2. **CORS**: The WordPress server must send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` including your production origin (e.g. `https://www.kandiegang.com`). Otherwise the browser blocks the GraphQL response.
3. **Check the endpoint**: In a new tab, open your GraphQL URL; you should see a GraphQL playground or a “GraphQL” response. If the domain or path is wrong, fix `VITE_WP_GRAPHQL_URL` and redeploy.

## 📬 Newsletter (Substack)

The newsletter signup on the landing page (after the FAQ) embeds your **Substack** publication’s signup form in a modal. No backend is required.

### Substack setup

1. Create or use an existing **Substack** publication (e.g. `https://yoursubstack.substack.com`).
2. In your project root, add to `.env` or `.env.local`:
   ```env
   VITE_SUBSTACK_PUBLICATION=https://yoursubstack.substack.com
   ```
3. Restart the dev server so the new env var is picked up.

The modal embeds Substack’s signup form via iframe (`/embed`). Users can subscribe without leaving your site. A link to “Open subscribe page in new tab” is also shown. If `VITE_SUBSTACK_PUBLICATION` is not set, the modal shows instructions to set the env var.

## 📧 Contact form (Formspree)

The contact form on the **Contact** page (`/contact`) and in the **Contact modal** (opened from the About page "Contact us" button) is powered by [Formspree](https://formspree.io). No backend is required. Spam is reduced with a honeypot field (`_gotcha`); Formspree ignores submissions where the honeypot is filled.

### Contact form setup

1. Create a form at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and copy the form ID (the value after `/f/` in your form endpoint, e.g. `xyzabcde`).
2. In your project root, add to `.env` or `.env.local`:
   ```env
   VITE_FORMSPREE_CONTACT_FORM_ID=your_formspree_form_id
   ```
3. **Enable AJAX submissions**: This app submits the form via JavaScript (no redirect). In your [Formspree form settings](https://formspree.io/forms), either **disable reCAPTCHA** for that form, or add your own **reCAPTCHA keys** (v3). Otherwise submissions will return 403 with: _"In order to submit via AJAX, you need to set a custom key or reCAPTCHA must be disabled."_
4. Restart the dev server so the new env var is picked up.

The shared `ContactForm` component (`components/ContactForm.tsx`) is used on both the Contact page and inside `ContactModal`. If `VITE_FORMSPREE_CONTACT_FORM_ID` is not set, the form area shows instructions to set the env var. On submit errors, the form displays Formspree’s error message when available. For stronger spam protection after enabling AJAX, you can add reCAPTCHA v3 or Turnstile in your Formspree dashboard.

## 📊 Analytics (PostHog)

Analytics are provided by [PostHog](https://posthog.com) and are **consent-gated**: the PostHog script only loads after the user accepts **analytics** in the cookie banner. If the user later revokes analytics in cookie preferences, PostHog stops sending data (`opt_out_capturing`).

## 🔔 Event Reminder Emails

Confirmed participants receive a reminder email approximately 24 hours before their event. The system is implemented as a Vercel Cron job.

### How it works

- **Schedule**: runs once daily at **07:00 UTC** (`0 7 * * *` in `vercel.json`)
- **Window**: finds all confirmed (non-waitlist, non-cancelled) registrations whose event falls **17–41 hours from now** — covering all events starting anytime the following calendar day
- **Deduplication**: `reminder_sent_at` is written to the registration row on first send; subsequent cron runs skip already-reminded registrations
- **Cancel token rotation**: each reminder issues a fresh cancel token and updates `cancel_token_hash` / `cancel_token_issued_at` in the same DB write, so the cancel link in the reminder email is always valid
- **Email**: personalised "See you tomorrow, [Name]!" with event title, level, date, event page link, and cancel link — styled to match all other Kandie Gang transactional emails

### Required migrations

Run against your Supabase database before deploying:

```sql
-- reminder_sent_at column
ALTER TABLE public.registrations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reminder_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- no_show_at column (for guide no-show tracking)
ALTER TABLE public.registrations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS no_show_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

### Required env vars

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Random secret; Vercel passes it as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` to the cron endpoint. Set in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables. |

> **Vercel Hobby limit**: cron jobs are limited to one execution per day. The 17–41h window is sized accordingly.

---

## 🗂️ Admin & Guide Tools

### Participant management (`/admin/analytics`)

Guides and admins can take per-participant actions directly from the Event Participation table:

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Remove from event** | Cancels the registration; promotes the next waitlisted person (sends them a new confirmation + cancel token) |
| **Mark as no-show** | Sets `no_show_at` on the registration. Does **not** open a waitlist spot — the slot was consumed. |
| **Send personal email** | Composes a custom email to that specific participant via Resend |

All actions are guide-authenticated (`POST /api/admin-update-profile` with `action=admin-remove-participant`, `admin-no-show`, or `admin-send-participant-email`).

### Guide dashboard (`/guide/analytics`)

Available at `/guide/analytics` to all users with `is_guide = true`. Displays:

- **Metric cards**: total rides (past / upcoming split), average participants per past event, no-show rate, cancellation rate, unique riders, repeat rider %
- **Charts**: confirmed spots by level (all-time) and events per month (last 12 months)
- **Event participation table**: full expandable event/participant table with management actions; email column hidden for privacy

---

## 🔐 Security audit (March 2026)

This repo received a quick security hardening pass with a focus on API safety and production resilience.

### Changes

- **Redis-backed rate limiting (with in-memory fallback)**: Shared rate limits across serverless instances when Upstash is configured; falls back to per-process buckets when Redis is unavailable. See `lib/rateLimit.ts` and API routes under `api/`.
- **Stricter admin profile updates**: `POST /api/admin-update-profile` (`api/admin-update-profile.ts`) validates the `updates` payload for the default **update** action using per-field rules (booleans, bounded strings, ISO dates, non-negative numbers, tag arrays, etc.). Invalid values on whitelisted keys return **400**; unknown keys are ignored. Guides only (Bearer token); rate-limited.
- **Email HTML escaping**: Event email templates now escape user-controlled strings (e.g. event titles / URLs / reasons) to prevent HTML injection in outbound emails.
- **PostHog SDK updated**: `posthog-js` upgraded to keep analytics SDK current.

### Required Vercel env vars (for Redis rate limiting)

Add these to **Development**, **Preview**, and **Production**:

```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
```

### Setup

1. Create a project at [posthog.com](https://posthog.com) and copy your **Project API Key** (e.g. `phc_...`).
2. In `.env` or your host's environment variables:
   ```env
   VITE_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_project_key
   ```
   Optional (for EU data residency):
   ```env
   VITE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://eu.i.posthog.com
   ```
3. Restart the dev server or redeploy so the env vars are picked up.

If `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` is not set, PostHog is never initialized and no analytics are sent.

### What is tracked

- **Autocapture**: Page views and default PostHog events (when consent is given).
- **Funnel events**: `added_to_cart`, `checkout_started`, `order_completed`, `checkout_cancelled`, `contact_form_submitted`, `members_area_viewed`, `signup_requested`, `login_requested`. Use these in PostHog **Insights → Funnels** to analyze conversion.

Event names are defined in `lib/posthog.ts` (`FUNNEL_EVENTS`). Init and consent logic live in `context/CookieConsentContext.tsx`; revocation calls `optOutPostHog()` from `lib/posthog.ts`.

## 💳 Stripe Checkout

The shop product pages (`/shop/:slug`) include Stripe Checkout integration for secure payment processing. Products support both public and member pricing, with automatic price selection based on user authentication status.

### Stripe setup

1. **Create a Stripe account** at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and get your API keys from the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   - For **local development**: Add to `.env` (never commit this file):
     ```env
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (your test secret key)
     ```
   - For **Vercel production**: Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**. Use `sk_live_...` for production.

3. **Set up Stripe Products and Prices**:
   - In your WordPress admin, ensure products have `stripePriceIdPublic` and optionally `stripePriceIdMember` set in the product fields.
   - Create corresponding Price objects in Stripe Dashboard and copy the Price IDs (e.g. `price_...`) to your WordPress product fields.

4. **Test the checkout flow**:
   - **Local development**: Run `npm run dev:vercel` (not `npm run dev`) to enable API routes
   - Use Stripe test cards (e.g. `4242 4242 4242 4242`) for testing
   - After successful checkout, users are redirected to `/checkout/success`
   - If checkout is cancelled, users return to the product page
   - **Note**: The API endpoint `/api/create-checkout-session` only works with `vercel dev` or when deployed to Vercel

### Checkout flow

- The `CheckoutButton` component (`components/CheckoutButton.tsx`) calls `/api/create-checkout-session` to create a Stripe Checkout session
- The Vercel serverless function (`api/create-checkout-session.ts`) handles session creation securely on the server
- Users are redirected to Stripe's hosted checkout page
- After payment, Stripe redirects back to `/checkout/success` or `/checkout/cancel`
- Product metadata (productId, productTitle, userId) is stored in the Stripe session for order tracking

### Product requirements

Products must have:
- `stripePriceIdPublic`: Required - Stripe Price ID for public/non-member pricing
- `stripePriceIdMember`: Optional - Stripe Price ID for member pricing (used if user is authenticated)
- `inStock`: Boolean flag to enable/disable checkout button
- `membersOnly`: Boolean flag to restrict checkout to authenticated members

## 🔄 Stripe Subscription Migration (WooCommerce → Stripe Billing)

The project includes a complete migration system to move from WooCommerce subscriptions to Stripe Billing with recurring subscriptions. This enables automated renewals, self-service member management via Stripe Customer Portal, and removes dependency on WordPress for subscription management.

### Migration Components

The migration system includes:

1. **Database Schema** ([supabase/migrations/20260215200000_add_stripe_subscription_fields.sql](supabase/migrations/20260215200000_add_stripe_subscription_fields.sql))
   - Adds Stripe tracking fields to profiles table
   - Stores customer IDs, subscription IDs, status, and billing dates

2. **Setup Scripts**
   - [scripts/setup-stripe-products.js](scripts/setup-stripe-products.js) - Create Stripe Products and Prices
   - [scripts/migrate-woo-to-stripe-subscriptions.js](scripts/migrate-woo-to-stripe-subscriptions.js) - Main migration script
   - [scripts/send-customer-portal-links.js](scripts/send-customer-portal-links.js) - Email portal links to members

3. **Webhook Updates** ([pages/api/stripe-webhook.ts](pages/api/stripe-webhook.ts))
   - Handles subscription lifecycle events (created, updated, deleted)
   - Processes renewal payments and payment failures
   - Keeps Supabase profiles in sync with Stripe subscription status

4. **Customer Portal** ([pages/api/create-portal-session.ts](pages/api/create-portal-session.ts))
   - API endpoint for members to manage subscriptions
   - Allows payment method updates, cancellations, and billing history

### Migration Features

- **Preserves existing billing dates**: No immediate charges - members continue on their current renewal schedule
- **Handles expired memberships**: Migrated as canceled subscriptions for history preservation
- **Idempotent**: Can be re-run safely without creating duplicates
- **DRY_RUN mode**: Test the migration without making changes
- **Detailed logging**: JSONL logs for audit and troubleshooting

### Quick Start

1. **Apply database migration:**
   ```bash
   # Connect to Supabase and run the migration
   # Or use Supabase CLI: supabase db push
   ```

2. **Set up Stripe products (test mode first):**
   ```bash
   # Make sure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY uses test keys in .env.local
   node scripts/setup-stripe-products.js
   # Copy the CLUB_MEMBERSHIP_PRICE_ID to .env.local
   ```

3. **Test migration with sample data:**
   ```bash
   # Create test-members.csv with 5-10 sample records
   DRY_RUN=true node scripts/migrate-woo-to-stripe-subscriptions.js test-members.csv
   ```

4. **Run real migration (test mode):**
   ```bash
   node scripts/migrate-woo-to-stripe-subscriptions.js members.csv
   ```

5. **Configure webhooks in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe-webhook`
   - Enable events: `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.payment_*`
   - Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

6. **Send portal links to members:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/send-customer-portal-links.js
   ```

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:
```env
# Stripe subscription migration
CLUB_MEMBERSHIP_PRICE_ID=price_...  # From setup-stripe-products.js
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...       # Use test keys first!
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Existing variables
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=Kandie Gang <members@yourdomain.com>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://kandiegang.com
```

### Detailed Documentation

For the complete migration plan with testing strategy, rollback procedures, and verification steps, see:
- Migration plan: [.claude/plans/idempotent-honking-breeze.md](.claude/plans/idempotent-honking-breeze.md)

**Important:** Always test with Stripe test keys first, create database backups, and use DRY_RUN mode for initial tests.

## 👤 Members area & Supabase profiles

The **Members area** (`/members`) and member login (StickyTop, offcanvas) use **Supabase Auth** and a **`profiles`** table. Profiles store membership status, plan names, and whether the user is a **Kandie Gang Guide**.

### What the app uses

- **Auth**: Email/password, magic link, or Discord OAuth. Session and user come from Supabase Auth.
- **Profile** (table `public.profiles`): One row per user (`profiles.id = auth.users.id`). The app reads:
  - `is_member`, `membership_source`, `membership_plans` (array, e.g. `["Kandie Gang Cycling Club Membership"]`), `member_since`, `membership_expiration`
         - **`is_guide`**: Boolean; marks the user as a Kandie Gang Guide (can be set manually).
  - **`is_substack_subscriber`**: Boolean; set by syncing from a Substack or Mailchimp CSV export (see below).
  - **`newsletter_opted_in_at`**: Date (YYYY-MM-DD) when the user opted in to the newsletter, when the CSV includes an opt-in date column.
- **Display**: Users can be both **Kandie Gang Cycling Member** (from a plan name containing "cycling" + "member"/"membership") and **Kandie Gang Guide** (from `is_guide` or a plan name containing "guide"). The Members page and account panel show both when applicable.

### Env vars

In `.env` or your host's config, set:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anon (public) key

Service role key is only for scripts (e.g. subscriber CSV sync), not the frontend.

### Membership updates

- Membership status is written in Supabase (Stripe webhook on checkout plus manual updates in Supabase).
- Use `membership_plans` with `Kandie Gang Cycling Club Membership` for cycling membership access.

### Subscriber sync

- **Substack or Mailchimp subscribers CSV**: Run `node scripts/sync-substack-subscribers-to-profiles.js [path-to-export.csv]` to set `is_substack_subscriber` and `newsletter_opted_in_at` by matching profile email to the export. **Substack**: Dashboard > Subscribers > Export. **Mailchimp**: Audience > Export audience. The script looks for an email column (e.g. "Email", "Email Address") and an optional opt-in date column (e.g. "OPTIN_TIME", "Timestamp", "Signup Date"). Re-run periodically to reflect current subscribers.

### Manual profile updates

To set someone as a member or Guide in Supabase (e.g. manual grant or no CSV): use the **Table Editor** or SQL in the Supabase Dashboard. Set `is_member`, `membership_plans`, and/or **`is_guide`** as needed; when you want Supabase to be the source of truth, set **`membership_source = 'supabase'`**. Full steps and field descriptions: **`supabase/MANUAL_PROFILE_UPDATES.md`**.

### Linked accounts (email + Discord)
  
Users can sign in with **email** (password or magic link) or **Discord** and link both to the same account so they don’t end up with duplicate profiles.
**Table**: `public.auth_providers` stores `(user_id, provider_type, provider_user_id)` with a unique constraint on `(provider_type, provider_user_id)` so each email or Discord ID can only be linked to one user. Migration: `supabase/migrations/20250208100000_create_auth_providers.sql`.
**Sync**: After each login (and after link/unlink), the app syncs the current user’s email and Discord identity into `auth_providers` via a secure API route (`/api/auth-providers`). This uses the Supabase service role key server-side, resolving previous 403 errors and keeping credentials safe.
**Settings**: **Account & security** (`/members/settings`) lists connected methods and lets users:
      - **Connect Discord** — links Discord to the current account (redirects to Discord; on return, the new identity is linked). Requires **manual linking** to be enabled in Supabase: Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → (e.g. Discord) or set `GOTRUE_SECURITY_MANUAL_LINKING_ENABLED: true` when self-hosting.
      - **Unlink** — remove a login method, with a confirmation step. At least one method must remain.
**Edge cases**: If a user tries to link a Discord (or email) that is already linked to another account, Supabase returns an error and the app shows a message. The unique constraint on `auth_providers` prevents duplicate links in the app’s own table.

Hooks: `hooks/useAuthProviders.ts` (list providers, link Discord, unlink). Auth context exposes `linkDiscord` and `unlinkIdentity` for use by the settings page.

### Migrations

Schema changes live in `supabase/migrations/`. Apply with `supabase db push` (CLI) or run the SQL in the Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor. The **`auth_providers`** table (linked accounts) was added in `20250208100000_create_auth_providers.sql`. The **`is_guide`** column was added in `20250206140000_add_is_guide_to_profiles.sql`. The **`is_substack_subscriber`** column was added in `20250206150000_add_is_substack_subscriber_to_profiles.sql`. The **`newsletter_opted_in_at`** column was added in `20250206160000_add_newsletter_opted_in_at_to_profiles.sql`.

## 🔐 Site password

The site can be protected with a full-screen password gate. It appears **after** the preloader finishes and **before** the homepage (or any other page) is shown.

### Flow

1. **Preloader** runs (glyphs, progress, “Let’s GOOOO!”).
2. Preloader exits → **password gate** appears (same purple background, “Enter password”).
3. User enters the correct password and submits → gate fades out → site loads.
4. Unlock is stored in **sessionStorage** for the current tab: reloads in the same tab skip the gate; a new tab or new session will see preloader then gate again.

### Configuration

- The password is set in `components/PasswordGate.tsx` (constant `SITE_PASSWORD`). The current value is **`letsgo!`**.
- To change or remove the gate, edit `PasswordGate.tsx` (e.g. change the constant or remove the gate from `App.tsx`).

This is a simple client-side lock suitable for soft launch or previews; it is not a substitute for server-side access control.

### Discord notifications

You can send each contact form submission to a Discord channel using [Formspree’s Discord plugin](https://help.formspree.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500002137941-Send-Discord-notifications) (Personal, Professional, Business plans).

1. **Create a Discord webhook**
   - In Discord: right‑click your server → **Server Settings** → **Integrations** (you need server owner or integration permissions).
   - Click **Create Webhook**, choose the channel, set name/avatar (e.g. “Formspree” and [Formspree logo](https://formspree.io/static/img/logo.png)), then **Copy Webhook URL**.

2. **Connect in Formspree**
   - Open your form in the [Formspree dashboard](https://formspree.io/forms) → **Plugins** tab.
   - Click the **Discord** plugin, paste the webhook URL, and click **Connect**. Formspree will send a test message to confirm.

Submissions will appear as messages in that channel. The contact form already sends a hidden `_subject` field (“New contact form submission”), which Formspree uses to set the subject/title of the Discord message. To change the channel later, disconnect the plugin and reconnect with a different webhook.

## 🛠️ Development
  
### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start Vite dev server (port 3000) - **Use this for all front-end development**
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run dev:vercel`: Serve built app + API routes - **Use this to test checkout**
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally

### Development Workflow

**For normal development (recommended):**
```bash
npm run dev
```
- ✅ Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- ✅ All front-end features work perfectly
- ✅ No console errors or 404s
- ❌ API routes (e.g. `/api/create-checkout-session`) won't work

**To test checkout or API routes:**
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev:vercel
```
- ✅ API routes work (Stripe checkout, webhooks, etc.)
- ✅ Serves the production build from `dist/`
- ⚠️ No HMR - you must rebuild after code changes
- 💡 Make sure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set in `.env.local`

**Why two modes?** Vercel's dev proxy interferes with Vite's dev server, causing 404s for `/@vite/client` and `@react-refresh`. So we use pure Vite for development, and only use `vercel dev` with a production build when testing API routes.

1. **WordPress Queries**: Always use the caching mechanism for WordPress queries unless you need fresh data. The cache automatically expires after 5 minutes.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks when WordPress content is unavailable. The app includes fallback content for all WordPress-dependent pages.

## 🎨 Design System

### Typography

The project uses IvyOra Display for headings and GTPlanar for body text (all normal weight; headings are not bold):

- **IvyOra Display** (`public/fonts/ivy-ora/`): Thin (`--font-heading-thin`), Light (`--font-heading-light`), Regular (`--font-heading-regular`) — used for h1–h6 and headline components
- **GTPlanar** (`public/fonts/gt-planar/`): Weights 250, 300, 400, 700 (normal/italic) — used for body text, paragraphs, and subheadlines (`--font-body`)

Fonts are loaded in `public/fonts/fonts.css`. Use CSS variables or utility classes:
- **Variables**: `var(--font-heading-thin)`, `var(--font-heading-light)`, `var(--font-heading-regular)`, `var(--font-body)`
- **Utility classes**: `.font-heading`, `.font-heading-thin`, `.font-heading-light`, `.font-heading-regular`, `.font-body`, `.font-headline`, `.font-subheadline`

Visit `/fonts` for the full typography showcase (IvyOra + GTPlanar).

### Color Palette

The design system uses a structured color palette organized into Primary and Secondary colors:

#### Primary Colors
- **Breath** (`--color-primary-breath`): `#FDF9F0` - Very light creamy off-white, ideal for backgrounds
- **Ecru** (`--color-primary-ecru`): `#F6F1E7` - Light beige, subtle background variations
- **Ink** (`--color-primary-ink`): `#1F2223` - Very dark gray, almost black, primary text color

#### Secondary Colors
- **Purple Rain** (`--color-secondary-purple-rain`): `#46519C` - Medium-dark desaturated blue-purple
- **Current** (`--color-secondary-current`): `#2A3577` - Dark deep desaturated blue
- **Blush** (`--color-secondary-blush`): `#F2ADAA` - Light soft muted pink
- **Drift** (`--color-secondary-drift`): `#09B7BB` - Vibrant bright teal/cyan
- **Signal** (`--color-secondary-signal`): `#FFF200` - Bright neon yellow, accents and highlights

#### Color Usage

Colors can be accessed via:
- **CSS Variables**: `var(--color-primary-ink)`, `var(--color-secondary-drift)`, etc.
- **Utility Classes**:
  - Background: `.bg-primary-breath`, `.bg-secondary-signal`
  - Text: `.text-primary-ink`, `.text-secondary-drift`
  - Border: `.border-primary-ecru`, `.border-secondary-purple-rain`

### Images

- **Guide photos**: Place JPG/PNG in `public/images/guides/` with filenames like `firstname_suffix.jpg` (e.g. `katrin_h.jpg`, `emma_b.jpg`). The **display name** in CompanySection is the part before the first underscore, capitalized (no underscore = whole name, e.g. `jeremy.jpg` → "Jeremy"). Used in `HomepageRotatingHeadline` (rotating avatar) and `CompanySection` (TeamLink hover, random order). Reference via `imageSrc('/images/guides/<basePath>', 400)` for small avatars or `imageSrc('/images/guides/<basePath>')` for full size.
- **Build optimization**: `npm run build` runs `scripts/optimize-images.js` after Vite: all images under `dist/images/` are converted to WebP (full + 400w, 800w, 1200w) and originals are removed. Use `lib/images.ts`: `imageSrc(basePath, width?)` and `imageSrcSet(basePath)` so dev uses `.jpg` from `public/` and production uses `.webp` from `dist/`.

### Design Principles

- **Glassmorphism**: Use `backdrop-blur-xl` combined with high-transparency backgrounds (`bg-white/80` or `bg-slate-100/50`) and subtle borders
- **Color System**: Use the structured primary/secondary color palette via CSS variables or utility classes for consistency
- **Typography**: Use IvyOra Display for headings (normal weight) and GTPlanar for body; see `index.css` and `public/fonts/fonts.css`
- **Spacing**: Generous white space (p-20+) to emphasize the premium minimalist feel
- **Animations**: Smooth, spring-based animations with consistent timing functions
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at `md:` (768px) and `lg:` (1024px)

## 🧠 Dynamic Content

### Weather Integration

The weather status bar uses **Open-Meteo** for current conditions and **ipapi.co** for location (no API keys required). Location defaults to Hamburg if IP lookup fails. To avoid CORS (ipapi.co and ip-api.com do not allow direct browser requests), the app calls a **same-origin proxy**:

- **Development**: Vite proxies `GET /api/geolocation` to `https://ipapi.co/json/` (see `vite.config.ts`).
- **Production (Vercel)**: The serverless function `api/geolocation.ts` fetches ipapi.co and returns the JSON. Deploy with Vercel so `/api/geolocation` is available; on other hosts you may need to add a similar proxy or the bar will fall back to Hamburg.

- **Location**: Resolved from the visitor’s IP via `/api/geolocation` (proxy to ipapi.co) for lat/lon, city, and timezone.
- **Weather**: Fetched from Open-Meteo (`/v1/forecast`) for temperature and WMO weather code; codes are mapped to display labels and icons.
- **Cycling outfit suggestion**: In-app logic based on temperature and condition (e.g. rain/snow) — not from an external AI.

The bar displays: date (in the resolved timezone), location label, temperature and condition with icons, and a short outfit suggestion.

### WordPress Content

All editorial content (About, Community, Stories) can be managed through WordPress. The app fetches content dynamically and provides fallback content when WordPress is unavailable.

## 🚢 Build & Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs `vite build` then `scripts/optimize-images.js`: images in `public/images/` (and subdirs like `guides/`) are converted to WebP and responsive widths (400, 800, 1200) in `dist/images/`. Original JPG/PNG are not copied to `dist`. Use `imageSrc()` and `imageSrcSet()` from `lib/images` in components so dev uses `.jpg` from `public/` and production uses `.webp` from `dist/`.

### Deployment

Production deploys from the **`main`** branch. The app uses path-based routing (no hash in URLs). SPA fallback is configured so direct visits and refreshes to routes like `/story/foo` work: `vercel.json` (Vercel) and `public/_redirects` (Netlify, copied to `dist` on build) serve `index.html` for all paths.

The app can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- **Vercel**: Connect your repository and deploy automatically (uses `vercel.json` for rewrites)
- **Netlify**: Use the build command `npm run build` and publish directory `dist` (uses `_redirects` from `public/`)
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Similar setup to Netlify
- **Traditional Hosting**: Upload the `dist/` folder to your web server

### Hosting Environment Variables

Make sure to set environment variables in your hosting platform:
- `VITE_WP_GRAPHQL_URL`: Your WordPress GraphQL endpoint
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL (for Members area and auth)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anon (public) key
- `VITE_SUBSTACK_PUBLICATION`: (Optional) Substack publication base URL for newsletter signup embed
- `VITE_FORMSPREE_CONTACT_FORM_ID`: (Optional) Formspree form ID for the contact form (Contact page and modal)
- `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`: (Optional) PostHog project API key for consent-gated analytics; `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` (e.g. `https://eu.i.posthog.com`) is optional for EU hosting

**Vercel warning: “VITE_ exposes this value to the browser”** — Vite inlines all `VITE_*` vars into the client bundle, so they are visible in the browser. The variables above are **safe to expose**: they are public URLs and public form IDs, not secrets. You can confirm and continue in Vercel when prompted.

## 👥 Guide/Participant Access Control & ID Sync

To ensure only the correct guides can view participants for an event level, the system matches your Supabase profile's `wp_user_id` to the WordPress guide's `databaseId` for that event level.

### How to verify and update your guide ID

1. **Print all guide IDs and your profile info:**
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key node scripts/print-guide-wp-ids.cjs
   ```
   This prints all Supabase guide profiles (with `wp_user_id`) and the guide IDs for each event level from WordPress. Compare your profile's `wp_user_id` to the correct WordPress guide `databaseId`.

2. **Update your Supabase profile's `wp_user_id` if needed:**
   - If your `wp_user_id` does not match your WordPress guide's `databaseId`, update it with:
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key node scripts/update-guide-wp-id.cjs
   ```
   This will set your profile's `wp_user_id` to the correct value for guide access control.

> **Note:** You must have the correct Supabase service role key and URL in your environment variables or pass them inline as shown above.

### Pending: guides missing WordPress ride_guide posts

The following guides have `is_guide: true` in Supabase but no `ride_guide` post in WordPress, so they cannot see event participants. Each needs a ride_guide post created in WP Admin → Ride Guides → Add New, then their `wp_user_id` in Supabase updated to the new post's databaseId.

| Name | Supabase email | Current wp\_user\_id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Benjamin N. | `benjamin@digitalsalat.de` | null |
| Annette Eicker | `annette.eicker@gmx.de` | 3 (wrong — old WP user ID) |

Once the WP posts are created, update each profile via the Supabase dashboard or REST API:

```http
PATCH /rest/v1/profiles?id=eq.<supabase_user_id>
{ "wp_user_id": <new_ride_guide_databaseId> }
```
